### RailML version 3.1 conversion of XSD schema fails as the 'namespace' aspect does not exist. This is a primary and mandatory aspect of a XSD schema. Therefore the equivalent code version of 2.4 is not available.

The officially released railMLÂ® 3.1 scheme version is available [here](https://www.railml.org/en/download/schemes.html?file=files/download/schemas/versions/railML-3.1.zip) for free download.

Please note the railML license agreement and the requirement for certification before productive use.

Version: 3.1 (SVN revision number 989)
Status: Official release for productive use
Release date: February 19th, 2019
